This is a custom theme for the Markdown editor [Typora](https://typora.io/).

My custom Typora theme is now featured on the official site! üéâ  
Check it out here: [Typora Themes](https://theme.typora.io/)

# Introduce

- **Notion-like design** for a clean and minimal look.
- **Compact file tree** to display more files and directories.
- **Precise replication** of Notion‚Äôs aesthetics.
- The file tree and outline styles are based on [Mdmdt](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Mdmdt/). Adjustments have been made to the size, color, and some elements to better integrate with the overall Notion-like theme.
